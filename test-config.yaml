# will not spawn or control any local instances of Asterisk; instead, it
# will use an SSH connection to run CLI commands against remote Asterisk
# instances and point its AMI/AGI/ARI interfaces at the configured instance(s).
#
# Note that the remote system should be in your known_hosts file before
# running a test.
