        summary: 'Test changing a password w/ passwordlocation=spooldir'
        description: |
            A voicemail user logs into their mailbox using voicemailmain and
            then changes their password via DTMF menu commands. This test
            confirms that playback of menu dialog occurs as expected for this
            operation and also that changes to the password are stored in the
            appropriate location in the Asterisk voicemail spool directory.
