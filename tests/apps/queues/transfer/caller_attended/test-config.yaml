    summary: "Caller initiated attended queue transfer"
    description: |
        "This verifies a caller initiated attended transfer using queues works
         as expected and that the app_queue's attended transfer stasis callback
         handler is executed appropriately.

         Alice dials into a queue and connects with member bob. Once alice and
         bob are bridged, alice puts bob on hold, and then dials charlie. After
         alice and charlie are bridged alice transfers bob to charlie using an
         attended transfer."
