    summary: 'Test for SIP channel handling the Incomplete application notifications'
    description: |
        The test exercises SIP handling of the 484 Address Incomplete response in the presence
        of the Incomplete application.  The Incomplete application will queue up a control frame
        that notifies the SIP channel driver that it is waiting for more digits.  The SIP channel
        driver will interpret that to mean that it should inform the dialing device that the address
        was incomplete, at which point it will attempt to dial a new extension.  The test succeeds
        if the new extension is dialed; it fails if any other extension is reached or if the new
        extension is not dialed.
