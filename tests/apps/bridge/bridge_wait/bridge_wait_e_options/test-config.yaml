    summary: 'Tests the e options of the BridgeWait application'
    description: |
        'This test covers all the ways that a channel can be entertained within
         a holding bridge. It tests the e(m), m(), e(n), e(s), e(r), and e(h).
         The e(m) deals with playing music while on hold, m() is specifically to check
         that MoH is playing to the participant, e(n) is to have no entertainment
         in the Bridge, e(s) is to have silence within the Bridge, e(r) is to have
         the holding Bridge ring without a pause and e(h) is to have a channel put
         on hold.'
