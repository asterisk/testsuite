    description: |
        'This test verifies that when the F option is used to bridge two channels and
         the appropriate channel hangs up first that the other channel will be directed
         to the appropriate extension based on the arguments of F. The test passes if
         it reaches all of the expected pass events on the appropriate channel in the
         correct order.'
