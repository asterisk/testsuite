    summary: 'Test marked user/waitmarked user in a Conference'
    description: |
        This tests the behavior of ConfBridge with a Marked user and a WaitMarked
        user. This involves three scenarios:
        (1) A scenario that tests that when a WaitMarked user enters first and
        leaves last, the conference puts them into an INACTIVE state
        (2) A scenario that tests that when a Marked user enters first the
        conference starts, but when the Marked user leaves the WaitMarked user
        is put into an INACTIVE state
        (3) A scenario that tests that a Marked user always keeps the conference
        active, regardless of a WaitMarked user entering/leaving
