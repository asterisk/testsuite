    summary: 'Tests interactions between waitmarked, marked, and unmarked users.'
    description:
        This test includes a few scenarios involving waitmarked, marked, and normal
        users joining and leaving a Conference at different times.
        The first scenario starts with a waitmarked, followed by a normal, and
        then by a marked. The marked user will then leave the Conference.
        The second scenario is the same, except the normal and marked users switch
        entering times.
        The third scenario starts with a normal user entering the Conference, followed
        by a waitmarked user that should be put in a waiting state until the marked
        user joins, where all users will be joined in the same Conference.
        The fourth scenario is the same, except the waitmarked and marked users
        switch entering times, meaning that the waitmarked user should immediately
        be placed into the Conference.

      # Scenario 1
      # A waitmarked user enters the Conference and is played music on hold. A
      # normal user enters the Conference after that, and the waitmarked user
      # should continue to hear music on hold. After that, a marked user will join
      # the Conference, and the waitmarked user should then be placed into the
      # Conference with the other 2 users. Finally, the marked user will leave
      # the Conference, and the waitmarked should once again hear music on hold,
      # and the normal user should hear music on hold as well.

      # Scenario 4
      # In this scenario, the normal user enters the Conference first, followed by
      # the marked user. The waitmarked user should then join the Conference, and
      # should immediately be placed into the Conference with the other 2 users. If
      # music on hold is played to the waitmarked user, the test should fail.
