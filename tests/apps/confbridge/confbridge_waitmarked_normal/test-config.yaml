    summary: "Tests interaction between waitmarked and normal users"
    description: |
          This test is testing the interaction between waitmarked and normal
          users. It is doing this through three scenarios.
          (1) The waitmarked user joins the conference and hears MOH. Then the
              Normal user joins the conference to change the state to SINGLE,
              yet the waitmarked user continues to hear MOH.
          (2) The Normal user joins the conference, then the waitmarked user
              joins and is played conf-waitforleader and is listening to MOH.
          (3) The Waitmarked user joins the conference followed by the Normal
              user. Then the Normal user leaves the conference and the Waitmarked
              user does not change state, until the channel is hung up.
