    summary: 'Test marked users in a Conference'
    description: |
        This tests the behavior of ConfBridge with two Marked users.  It covers
        checking that marked users receive the proper notifications when they
        do not have the quiet flag; that they do not receive the notifications
        when they have the quiet flag; that MOH is not played to marked users
        at any time; and that the conference transitions appropriately between
        its various states.  Two scenarios are used to cover this test - one
        where a marked user enters first without the quiet flag, and one where a
        marked user enters first with the quiet flag.

      # notifications are played.  Marked User Two leaves; Marked User One
      # leaves.  Verify that conference transitions occur as expected.
