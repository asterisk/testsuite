    summary: 'Tests interaction between marked and unmarked users in a Conference'
    description: |
        This tests the interaction of normal users and marked users in a conference. It
        specifically goes into checking whether the Marked and Normal users received the
        proper notifications; that MOH is played when the Normal user is the last or
        first person in the conference; And that all of the transitions between states in
        the conference are working appropriately. This test contains three scenarios -
        the first in which the marked user enters first and hangs up last; the second
        includes the marked user entering first and the normal user hanging up last;
        lastly, the third tests when the normal user enters the conference first and
        leaves last.

      # conference. Normal user leaves, followed by the Marked user. Checks to make sure
      # all conference state transitions executed as planned.

      # Scenario 3: The Normal user enters and receives a MOH event. Gets notifications
      # of their presence in the conference, but receives no notification of position in
      # conference. Marked user enters, which stops the MOH; gets notifications of their
      # presence in the conference. Marked user leaves, followed by the Normal user who
      # has a MOH event taking place. Checks to make sure all conference state transitions
      # executed as planned.
