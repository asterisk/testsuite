    summary: 'Tests interactions between waitmarked, marked, and endmarked users.'
    description:
        This test verifies that when a waitmarked, an endmarked, and a waitmarked
        endmarked user all join a Conference, they all wait for the marked user to
        join. They should all be able to interact with each other once the marked
        user joins. When the marked user leaves, all users with the endmarked
        tag should be removed from the Conference. The waitmarked user should return
        to its waiting state.

      # Scenario 1
      # A waitmarked user, an endmarked user, and an endmarked/waitmarked user all
      # join a Conference and should hear music on hold while they wait for the marked
      # user to join. Once the marked user joins, each user should be able to interact
      # with each other. When the marked user leaves, every user with the endmarked
      # tag should be removed from the Conference, and the waitmarked user should
      # return to its waiting state.
