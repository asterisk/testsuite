    summary: 'Test two waitmarked users in a Conference'
    description:
        This tests checks that when a waitmarked user joins a Conference, MusicOnHold
        is played to that user, and when another waitmarked user joins the Conference,
        the MusicOnHold should continue to play for the previous user as well as the
        new user. No marked users or users of any other kind will join the Conference.

  scenarios:
    -
      # Scenario 1
      # Two waitmarked users join a Conference. Both should hear music on hold,
      # and should continue to hear it for the duration of the test. If either
      # user stops hearing it when the other joins/leaves, the test should fail.
      # No marked users will join, and the test will pass if both waitmarked users
      # sit in the Conference for a duration without music on hold stopping.
      # Both users will then hang up and the scenario will end.
