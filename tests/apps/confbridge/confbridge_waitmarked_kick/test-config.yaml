    summary: 'Test ConfBridge behavior when Marked/WaitMarked users are kicked'
    description: |
        This tests the behavior of ConfBridge with a Marked user and WaitMarked
        users when those users are kicked out of the conference. This test
        ensures that having a large number of users with different roles that
        are booted quickly does not perturb the ConfBridge state transitions.
        In this test, three WaitMarked users enter into a ConfBridge, followed
        by a Marked user. When the Marked user joins, they are immediately
        kicked from the conference. When the Marked user leaves, the three
        WaitMarked users are also kicked from the Conference.
