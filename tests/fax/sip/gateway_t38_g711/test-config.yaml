    summary: 'Test the fax gateway.'
    description: |
        This test verifies proper gateway functionality when the sending side
        is t38 and the receiving side is g711. Two asterisk instances are
        started and a call is made from ast1 to ast2. Ast2 will start a fax
        gateway and send the call back to ast1. Ast2 runs SendFax() on the
        sending side and ReceiveFax() on the receiving side. If the fax is
        successful, the test passes.

        The call flow looks like this:
         |send        |
         |t38      t38|
         |----------->|
         |     gateway|
         |g711    g711|
