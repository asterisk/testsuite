    summary: Test TONE_DETECT function emitting ARI events
    description: |
        "Takes a Local channel and sets the TONE_DETECT function
        on one half of the channel, and streaming audio through
        on the other half.

        When the test starts, both Local channel halves are placed
        into a Stasis application. A subscription is made to the
        ;1 channel, which is released into the dialplan.

        The dialplan manages each iteration of the test; when
        the ;1 channel has the appropriate TONE_DETECT settings
        enabled on it, it enters into another Stasis application.
        This Stasis application causes media to be played on the
        ;2 channel.

        The test consists of 2 iterations:
         - An iteration that tests the base settings for TONE_DETECT.
           1 event is expected.
         - An iteration with TONE_DETECT on another frequency than played.
           No events are expected."
