    summary: Test subscribing to a technology from an application.
    description: |
        This test covers nominal subscribing to an endpoint through
        its technology and receiving events about the endpoints and
        the channels associated with that endpoint. The test:
        - Subscribes for updates about IAX2
        - Originates a Local channel that dials an IAX2 endpoint
          (alice/alice) and a PJSIP channel that dial a PJSIP
          endpoint (bob). Both alice and bob are on the ast2
          instance.
        - The test verifies that we receive no updates about the
          PJSIP resource (as we didn't subscribe for it), and that
          we receive endpoint state notifications for the IAX2
          resource and its channel.
