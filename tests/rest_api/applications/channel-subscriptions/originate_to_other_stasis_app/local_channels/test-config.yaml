        "Test subscriptions when originating a local channel to another Stasis
        app and dialplan."
    description: |
        "This test creates two Stasis apps each with a separate websocket. Once
        both websockets are established a local channel is originated from AppA
        with specifying app AppB. Local channel half 'StasisHalf' is placed
        into Stasis app AppB while the other half 'DpHalf' is put into the
        dialplan where it executes dialplan applications and eventually hangs
        up.

        This test verifies that both channel halves have been subscribed to by
        the AppB Stasis app and AppB receives ARI events from both halves. It
        ensures AppB receives ChannelDialplan events showing the dialplan
        progression for 'DpHalf' and a StasisStart event for 'StasisHalf'. It
        also ensures AppA does not receive any of the ARI events that is
        expected for AppB to receive."
