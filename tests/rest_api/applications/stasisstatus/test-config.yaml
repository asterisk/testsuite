        Tests that Stasis correctly applies the STASISSTATUS channel
        variable.
    description: |
        The test exercises Stasis in three ways to determine if is
        functioning as advertised.
        -   For the first case (Babs), a channel is originated under normal
        conditions and then the channel is hungup. For this case, the
        test verifies that Stasis correctly assigns SUCCESS to STASISSTATUS.
        -   For the second case (Bugs), a channel is originated using an app
        that was never registered with Stasis. The test verifies that Stasis
        correctly assigns FAILED to STASISSTATUS.
        -   For the third case (Buster), a channel is made under normal
        conditions, but, before the channel is hungup and while the channel is
        still active, the websocket is disconnected. A channel is then
        originated using the app that was just unregistered. For this case,
        the test verifies that Stasis correctly assigns FAILED to STASISSTATUS.
