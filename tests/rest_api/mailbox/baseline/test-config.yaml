    summary: Tests basic mailbox modification and retrieval in ARI.
    description: |
        Create a couple mailboxes through ARI and confirm they can
        be retrieved individually as well as within a list with the
        expected values. Modify one and delete the other and confirm
        that when the list is generated again that the deleted
        mailbox is not in the list and that the modified mailbox has
        the new expected values in it.
