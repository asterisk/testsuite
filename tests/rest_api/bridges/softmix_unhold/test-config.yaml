    summary: 'Test channel unhold when bridge transitions to softmix'
    description: |
        This tests that a channel on hold is taken off hold if the bridge
        it's currently in transitions to softmix.

        Add two channels to a mixing bridge. Then put one channel on hold.
        Lastly, add a third channel to the bridge, and make sure the
        appropriate unhold events are raised signifying that the channel
        was take off of hold.
