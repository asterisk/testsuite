    summary: Tests that the forward ARI playback command on bridges works as intended
    description: |
        This test puts a local channel half into Stasis, and the other into the Echo
        application.  The channel that enters Stasis then gets put into a bridge.
        Starts an ARI playback of tt-monkeys on the bridge, and as soon as the playback
        starts, fast forwards the playback. Test passes if a playback FastForward
        TestEvent gets received.
