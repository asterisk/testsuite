    summary: Test detection of RecordingStarted and RecordingFinished events
             from bridge topic during bridges/record
    description: |
        This creates a bridgeand places a channel in the bridge implicitly
        subscribing to it. Then the test executes the bridges/record ARI
        command to it. Upon receiving the RecordingStarted event, the
        recording will be stopped. The RecordingStarted and RecordingFinished
        events must be received in order for the test to be considered
        successful.
