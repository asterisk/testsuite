    summary: 'Test for getting a single module using ARI'
    description: |
        Test that returns a single requested module that is to be
        autoloaded based on the modules.conf configuration. The test
        checks the response body of the module, so that it matches
        that of the expected response body specified within the yaml
        configuration. It also checks to make sure that a '200 OK' was
        received back as a response from the request.
