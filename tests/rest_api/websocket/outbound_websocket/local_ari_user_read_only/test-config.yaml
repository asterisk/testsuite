    summary: Test that local_ari_user read-only is respected
    description: |
        Test Steps
         * The test script originates a call between the 'stasis' and 'echo'
           extensions. This causes asterisk to open a websocket connection to the
           test script and send ApplicationRegistered and StasisStart.
         * The test script verifies that the Authorization header is present and correct.
         * The test script detects the first ApplicationRegistered which it ignores.
         * The test script detects StasisStart and answers the call using a
           REST over Websocket request.
         * Asterisk determines that the configured local_ari_user has only read-only
           permissions and responds with a 403 Forbidden in a RESTResponse.
         * The test script detects the 403 and marks the test as passed then issues
           a 'channel request hangup all' CLI command.
         * Asterisk hangs up the call, sends a StasisEnd and closes teh websocket.
         * The test script detects the websocket close and stops the reactor.
