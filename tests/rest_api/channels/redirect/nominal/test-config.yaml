    summary: Test redirecting channels using ARI
    description: |
        This test covers redirecting channels using ARI. Specifically,
        it does the following:
        - The first Asterisk instance (ast1) acts as a call generator
          using a Stasis application. It spawns calls to the second
          Asterisk instance (ast2). If a call is forwarded - which is
          detected by a Local channel entering the destination extension
          (ast3 or ast4), it creates a new call to that server and
          bridges it with the Local channel.
        - The second Asterisk instance (ast2) acts as a load balancer.
          As calls are received from ast1, it picks a server to forward
          them to in a round-robin fashion. It then uses the /redirect
          operation on the channels resource to forward the calls to
          the specified server.
        - The third and fourth Asterisk instances (ast3 and ast4)
          receive the forwarded calls.
        Two Stasis applications handle the test: a call generator,
        connected to ast1, and the load balancer, connected to ast2,
        ast3, and ast4. When the load balancer detects that all calls
        have been forwarded to ast3 and ast4, it stops the test. A
        total of 10 calls are processed, with 5 being forwarded to both
        ast3 and ast4.
