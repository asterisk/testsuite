        "Transfer (attended) Stasis bridge to Stasis bridge in different Stasis
         apps"
    description: |
        "Upon the kick off local channel entering into the Stasis(testsuite)
         app, a call is made from the 'alice' PJSUA account that is put into
         Stasis(app_A). The Stasis bridge 'test_bridge_a' is created and
         alice is added to it. A channel is originated to the 'bob' PJSUA
         account and put into the same Stasis(app_A) app and bridge with
         alice. Alice begins an attended transfer by making another call. The
         second alice channel is put into the different app Stasis(app_B), the
         Stasis bridge 'test_bridge_b' is created, and the second alice channel
         is added to Stasis bridge. A channel is then originated to the 'carol'
         PJSUA account and put into the same Stasis(app_B) app and bridge
         with the second alice channel.

         Alice then completes the attended transfer essentially transferring
         the Stasis bridge to the other Stasis bridge via different Stasis
         apps. Asterisk does this by creating a Local channel where each half
         is swapped in place of the two alice channels. After the transfer is
         successful with a local replacement channel half in the Stasis bridge
         with bob via app_A and another in the Stasis bridge with carol via
         app_B, bob is hung up. Carol is then hung up and so is the local
         replacement channel half that was in the Stasis bridge with bob. This
         causes the other local replacement channel half that was in the Stasis
         bridge with carol to be hung up and triggers the hang up of the kick
         off local channel and the destruction of the stasis bridges.

         This test verifies that a Stasis bridge can be transferred (attended)
         to a Stasis bridge via different Stasis apps. It also verifies that
         the StasisStart & StasisEnd events occur for the alice(both), bob,
         carol, and local replacement channels."
