        "Transfer (attended) Stasis bridge to Stasis bridge in same Stasis app"
    description: |
        "NOTE - The only difference between this test and the same_stasis_app
         test is that the transferer hangs up immediately after the REFER has
         been accepted instead of waiting until receiving the NOTIFY with the
         200 OK frag. This allows the test to make sure the transfer completes
         even when Asterisk receives an early BYE.

         Upon the kick off local channel entering into the Stasis(testsuite)
         app, a call is made from the 'alice' PJSUA account that is put into
         Stasis(testsuite). The Stasis bridge 'test_bridge_a' is created and
         alice is added to it. A channel is originated to the 'bob' PJSUA
         account and put into the same Stasis(testsuite) app and bridge with
         alice. Alice begins an attended transfer by making another call. The
         second alice channel is put into the same Stasis(testsuite) app, the
         Stasis bridge 'test_bridge_b' is created, and the second alice channel
         is added to Stasis bridge. A channel is then originated to the 'carol'
         PJSUA account and put into the same Stasis(testsuite) app and bridge
         with the second alice channel.

         Alice then completes the attended transfer essentially transferring
         the Stasis bridge to the other Stasis bridge within the same Stasis
         app. Asterisk does this by creating a Local channel where each half is
         swapped in place of the two alice channels. After the transfer is
         successful with a local replacement channel half in the Stasis bridge
         with bob and another in the Stasis bridge with carol, bob is hung up.
         Carol is then hung up and so is the local replacement channel half
         that was in the Stasis bridge with bob. This causes the other local
         replacement channel half that was in the Stasis bridge with carol to
         be hung up and triggers the hang up of the kick off local channel and
         the destruction of the stasis bridges.

         This test verifies that a Stasis bridge can be transferred (attended)
         to a Stasis bridge in the same Stasis app. It also verifies that the
         StasisStart & StasisEnd events occur for the alice(both), bob, carol,
         and local replacement channels."
