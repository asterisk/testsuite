    summary: "Transfer (attended) non-Stasis app to Stasis bridge"
    description: |
        "Upon the kick off local channel entering into the Stasis(testsuite)
         app, the Stasis bridge 'test_bridge' is created. A call is made from
         the 'alice' PJSUA account and put into the Echo() app. Alice begins
         an attended transfer by making another call that is put into the
         Stasis(testsuite) app and then added to the 'test_bridge' stasis
         bridge. A channel is then originated to the 'bob' PJSUA account and
         put into the same Stasis(testsuite) app and added to the 'test_bridge'
         stasis bridge with the second call from alice.

         Alice then completes the attended transfer essentially transferring
         the Echo() app to the Stasis bridge. Asterisk does this by creating a
         Local channel where half masquerades into the Echo() app and the other
         half is swapped with the channel of the second call from alice. After
         the transfer is successful with the local replacement channel half in
         the 'test_bridge' stasis bridge with bob, bob is hung up. This then
         initiates the tear down of the local channels and destruction of the
         stasis bridge.

         This test verifies that a non-Stasis app can be transferred (attended)
         to a Stasis bridge. It also verifies that the StasisStart & StasisEnd
         events occur for the alice, bob, and local replacement channels."
