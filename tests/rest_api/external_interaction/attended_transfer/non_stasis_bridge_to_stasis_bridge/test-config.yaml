    summary: "Transfer (attended) non-Stasis bridge to Stasis bridge"
    description: |
        "This test verifies that a non-Stasis bridge can be transferred
         (attended) to a Stasis bridge. It also verifies that the StasisStart &
         StasisEnd events occur for the alice(second), carol, and local
         replacement channels.

         Upon the kick off local channel entering into the Stasis(testsuite)
         app, a call is made from the 'alice' PJSUA account that executes the
         Dial() app and calls the 'bob' PJSUA account. Once alice and bob are
         in a non-Stasis bridge, alice begins an attended transfer by making
         another call. The second alice channel is put into the
         Stasis(testsuite) app, the Stasis bridge 'test_bridge' is created, and
         the second alice channel is added to Stasis bridge. A channel is then
         originated to the 'carol' PJSUA account and put into the same
         Stasis(testsuite) app and added to the Stasis bridge 'test_bridge'
         with the second alice channel.

         Alice then completes the attended transfer essentially transferring the
         non-Stasis bridge to the Stasis bridge. Asterisk does this by creating
         a Local channel where each half is swapped in place of the two alice
         channels. After the transfer is successful with a local replacement
         channel half in the non-Stasis bridge with bob and another in the
         Stasis bridge with carol, bob is hung up. This then initiates the hang
         up of the local replacement channel half that was in the non-Stasis
         bridge with bob and the hang up of the local replacement channel half
         that was in the Stasis bridge with carol. Carol is also hung up which
         initiates the hung up of the kick off local channel and the destruction
         of the stasis bridge."
