        "Verify StasisStart and StasisEnd events when channels are put into a
         Stasis application, bridged, and one channel is blind transferred to
         a non-stasis application."
    description: |
        "A dummy local channel is created with half the channel placed into the
         Stasis(testsuite,dummy) application and the other half placed into the
         Echo() application. This sole purpose of this dummy channel is to have
         a channel up preventing the test from immediately ending and thus
         keeping the websocket connected, to allow StasisEnd events for all
         other channels to be verified.

         The kick off local channel ('Alice') is entered into the
         Stasis(testsuite) app and a Stasis bridge is created. A SIP channel
         ('Bob') is then entered into the Stasis(testsuite,test) app and added
         to the bridge with alice. Bob blind transfers Alice to the Echo() app
         via extension 1000. The local channel half replacing Bob's is added to
         the bridge with Alice. The other local channel half executes the Echo()
         app. The StasisStart events for all channels (except the dummy halves)
         are verified.

         Upon the local channel half entering the bridge replacing Bob's
         channel, the channel and Alice's channel are hung up. The bridge is
         then also destroyed. Once all StasisEnd events have been verified,
         the dummy channel halves are hung up thus ending the test."
