        "Ensure channel in Stasis bridge can be pulled out using the Bridge()
        app and resumes at the priority after the Stasis() app."
    description: |
        "This test originates a Local channel (dummy) channel into
        Stasis(testsuite,dummy) and Echo() to kick off the test. A Stasis
        bridge is created (test_bridge) along with originating a Local channel
        (alice) into Stasis(testsuite,test) and Echo(). The alice channel is
        then added to the Stasis bridge upon a StasisStart event.

        A Local channel (bob) is originated into Bridge() and echo(). This
        causes the alice channel half in the Stasis bridge to be pulled out and
        put into a non-stasis bridge with the bob channel half. The bob channel
        half in the non-stasis bridge with alice is then hung up.

        This ensures that the alice channel half is not re-entered into the
        Stasis(testsuite,test) app and instead executes the priority following
        it. The StasisStart and StasisEnd events are all also checked to ensure
        they occur the proper number of times."
