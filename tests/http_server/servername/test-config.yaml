    summary: Tests the http-server 'servername' property.
    description: |
        This test connects as a client to a running instance of the asterisk
        http-server. After making an arbitrary request, the test parses the
        response headers to verify the value returned in the 'Server' header
        matches the expected value. The expected values that are tested follow
        the three possible logic paths: the default value when nothing is
        provided through configuration, a configured value that is non-empty
        and a configured value that is empty/null.
