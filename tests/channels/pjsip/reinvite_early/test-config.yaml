    summary: 'Ensure graceful operation when receiving an unexpected early reINVITE.'
    description: |
        'A SIPp scenario places a call into Asterisk.  Once the call has
        been answered, the caller sends a reINVITE before sending the
        ACK to the initial INVITE.  Asterisk should respond to the reINVITE
        with a 491 because it has not seen the ACK completing the initial
        INVITE transaction.  Once the reINVITE is completed the SIPp scenario
        completes the original INVITE and hangs up the call.

        The reason this test exists is because Asterisk would crash on the
        early reINVITE because the reINVITE was not identified and was treated
        as an initial INVITE.  The call wound up with two PBX threads running
        on the same channel.  This test ensures that the code changes have
        fixed the issue as expected.'
