    summary:     'Tests sips/tls and dtls/sdes'
    description: |
        'Run three instances of Asterisk, "alice", "pbx", and "bob" to test
         two party calls. sips/tls is used for signalling between all parties.
         alice<>pbx uses dtls for media.
         pbx<>bob uses sdes for media.
         All 3 instances have the same ciphers enabled.
         alice has keys and certs from CA1.
         pbx has keys and certs from CA1.
         pbx has a ca-bundle.crt file that includes CA2's cert.
         bob has keys and certs from CA2 and has CA1's cert in the etc dir.
         c_rehash was run on bob's etc dir to make CA1's cert available via
            ca_list_path
         All 3 instances verify certs.

         Both alice and bob send audio to each other while
         both also listen for audio. Alice then initiates the hang. This
         ensures that both alice and bob receive audio.
