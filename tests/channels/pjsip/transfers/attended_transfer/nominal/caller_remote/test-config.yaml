    summary: "Nominal caller initiated remote attended transfer."
    description: |
        "This test uses two Asterisk and a PJSUA instance to perform a remote
        attended transfer. For PJSUA to properly perform the transfer, it does
        not register to either Asterisk instance.

        Alice (PJSUA) first calls Asterisk 1 which goes into the dialplan and
        dials a Local channel that executes Echo(). Once it is confirmed that
        Alice and Asterisk 1 are bridged, Alice places the call on hold. Alice
        then calls Asterisk 2 which goes into the dialplan and dials a Local
        channel that executes Echo(). Once it is confirmed that Alice and
        Asterisk 2 are bridged, Alice performs an attended transfer.

        The attended transfer results in Alice sending a REFER request to
        Asterisk 1. Since the referenced dialog in the Refer-To header of the
        REFER is not known by Asterisk 1, Asterisk 1 must perform a remote
        attended transfer. The end result should be that Asterisk 1 and
        Asterisk 2 are connected via SIP, and both of Alice's calls are hung
        up.

        From the perspective of the Asterisk server performing the transfer, a
        remote attended transfer appears to be a blind transfer. Therefore a
        BlindTransfer AMI event is emitted.

        This test ensures that Asterisk 1 properly handles a REFER that refers
        to a remote dialog and that Asterisk 2 properly handles receiving an
        INVITE with Replaces."
