    summary: Test performing a caller-initiated attended transfer via chan_pjsip.
    description: |
        "Originate two SIP calls through Asterisk to remote endpoints and then have
        one originating call transfer the other via REFER with Replaces header.

        The four SIPp scenarios involved perform the following actions:
        SIPp #1 (referer.xml) calls through Asterisk to SIPp #2 (uas.xml)
        SIPp #1 kicks off SIPp #3 (referee.xml) which calls SIPp #4 (uas_hangup.xml).
        SIPp #3 passes call information back to SIPp #1.
        Before SIPp #4 answers SIPp #1 initiates an attended transfer via REFER with Replaces information from SIPp #3.
        SIPp #3 is hung up.
        SIPp #1 hangs up.
        SIPp #4 continues to ring until it answers.
        SIPp #2 receives a connected line update and the values are checked.
        SIPp #4 answers.
        SIPp #2 and SIPp #4 are bridged.
        SIPp #4 receives a connected line update and the values are checked.
        SIPp #4 hangs up.
        SIPp #2 is hung up."
