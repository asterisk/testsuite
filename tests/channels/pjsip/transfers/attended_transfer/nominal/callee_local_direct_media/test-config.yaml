    summary: "Callee initiated attended transfer w/Replaces, direct media, hold"
    description: |
        "This verifies a callee initiated local attended transfer with
         REFER/Replaces, hold, and direct media. This uses a specialized packet
         sniffer module that generates AMI UserEvents that are then checked to
         determine the result of this test.

         Alice calls bob via extension '101' and bob answers. Upon alice and
         bob being remotely bridged, bob places alice on hold. Upon alices's
         remote bridge being torn down, bob places a second call to charlie.
         Charlie answers and once bob's second call and charlie are remotely
         bridged, bob transfers alice to charlie via an attended transfer.

         This then checks some data from the REFER and NOTIFY sipfrag. It
         also ensures MOH is stopped on alice and that alice and charlie are
         remotely bridged. If a race condition occurs between pjsua putting a
         call on hold and Asterisk setting up direct media, the resulting 491
         Request Pending message is examined and hold is attempted again."
