<scenario name="Verify no MESSAGE received at redirect destination">
  <!-- This scenario verifies that NO MESSAGE is received at the redirect destination.

       Approach:
       1. Send OPTIONS to Asterisk to establish the scenario
       2. Receive response to OPTIONS (typically 401 Unauthorized)
       3. Pause for 5 seconds
       4. If any MESSAGE arrives during this time, SIPp will fail with "unexpected message"
       5. If no MESSAGE arrives, test passes -->

  <!-- Send OPTIONS to establish the scenario -->
