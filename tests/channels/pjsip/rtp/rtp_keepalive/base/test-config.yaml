    summary: 'Ensure that Asterisk sends RTP CNG packets'
    description: |
        'A SIPp test scenario calls into Asterisk and lands in an extension that
        runs the "Echo" application. The SIPp endpoint is configured to have RTP
        keepalives sent every three seconds. Since the SIPp scenario sends no RTP
        to Asterisk, Asterisk should send RTP keepalives to the SIPp scenario. This
        test ensures that the RTP keepalive packets are received and that they are
        spaced out approximately according to the specified interval.'
