    summary: 'Test ordering of endpoint identifiers'
    description: |
        'It is possible that two or more endpoint identifiers could match
         against an incoming call. This test makes sure that no matter what
         order the endpoint identifier modules were loaded priority is given
         based on the ones specified in the global endpoint_identifier_order
         option.

         It does this by starting two Asterisk instances. ast1 contains an
         endpoint alice that calls ast2 that also has an endpoint alice
         configured. ast2 also has configured an identify section that matches
         on the localhost. This causes a conflict between the username and
         ip endpoint identifiers. However, by specifying that the preferred
         endpoint identifier order is ip,username it can be guaranteed to
         identify the endpoint by ip and correctly choose the right endpoint.'
