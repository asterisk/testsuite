    summary: 'Ensure call is not terminated when frame with new SSRC and format is received'
    description: |
         'If the SSRC of a received RTP packet differed from the previous SSRC
          an SSRC change control frame would be queued ahead of the media
          frame. In the case of audio this would result in the format of the
          audio frame not being checked, and if it differed or was not allowed
          then it could cause the call to drop due to failure to set up a
          translation path. This test reproduces this scenario and ensures that
          the call is not dropped but instead the media is ignored.'
