    summary: Test Inbound Media Websocket
    description: |
        This test verifies the basic functionality of inbound media over
        websocket connections. A call is established between the Echo()
        dialplan app and chan_websocket which waits for an incoming
        connection.  The media client gets the connection id from the
        Dial event and opens a connection back to chan_websocket.  Once
        connected, the media client answers the call, sends the
        "test.ulaw" file and captures the echoed bytes.  When the transfer
        is finished, the media client compares what was sent to what was
        received and marks the test as passed if the bytes match.
