    summary: Test Outbound Media Websocket
    description: |
        This test verifies the basic functionality of outbound media over
        websocket connections. A call is established between the Echo()
        dialplan app and chan_websocket which makes an outbound connection
        to the test media server. Once connected, the media server answers
        the call, sends the "test.ulaw" file and captures the echoed bytes.
        When the transfer is finished, the media server compares what was
        sent to what was received and marks the test as passed if the bytes
        match.
