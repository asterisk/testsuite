    summary:     'Test SIP Blind Transfer (callee transfers)'
    description: |
        This test verifies a SIP Blind transfer in which
        Phone A calls Phone B through Asterisk.  Phone B then
        requests a transfer for Phone A to Phone C.  At the end
        of the test, Phone B is hung up, while Phone A and C
        are bridged together.  No re-INVITE is sent to put Phone A
        on hold before Phone A is transferred.
