    summary:    'Test that the Contact from the 200 is final'
    description: |
        'When a call is forked by a proxy, asterisk may receive provisional
        responses from more than one phone. It may remember/store the Contact,
        but it must use the final contact from the 200 for the ACK, not an old
        one.'
