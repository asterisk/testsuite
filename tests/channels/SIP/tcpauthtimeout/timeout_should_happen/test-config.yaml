    summary: 'Ensure TCP sessions close when auth timeout is reached.'
    description: |
        "This test opens a series of TCP connections with Asterisk and ensures that
        each is eventually closed by Asterisk once the auth timeout is reached. The
        following test scenarios are attempted:

            * Open a TCP connection and then do nothing.
            * Open a TCP connection and write some arbitrary data.
            * Open a TCP connection and write some SIP-like data.
            * Open a TCP connection and write several bursts of data.

        After each scenario is performed, we ensure that the TCP connection has been
        closed."
