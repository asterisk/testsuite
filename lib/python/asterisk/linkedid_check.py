This monitors bridge enter/exit and CEL events, and builds
a picture of which channels are bridged together, and when
their LinkedID changes, and then verifies that each change
is correct.

Note: The BridgeEnter and CEL 'BRIDGE_ENTER' events can be
in either order - so wait for both to arrive before making
a judgement on the LinkedID.

This test can be added to any other bridging test to add a
layer of LinkedId Propagation checking to it.  However the
creation of channels has to be done one at a time by using
a Newchannel event to trigger the next one - so that order
of creation can be determined.  Also required is that this
test module is listed before others to that it can process
bridge events first before the test makes changes.
